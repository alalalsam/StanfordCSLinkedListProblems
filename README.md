Now that I have a job, the code I write has to balance conciseness, understandability, and functionality. Unfortunately, this means I'm spending more time than ever before considering the semantics of what i write, instead of just shitting out code. How sickening.

i tried to solve the linked list problems with the most concise pointer-oriented trickery as possible, to prove to myself I know how to use pointers properly. This makes the code very cryptic. IDK why anyone would use malloc and pointer-based data structures when they can just use arrays. real life code should never look like this.
