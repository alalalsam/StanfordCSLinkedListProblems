# StanfordCSLinkedListProblems
Solutions to Nick Parlante's LinkedListProblems pdf. go here: http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/ 

Now that I have a job, the code I write has to balance conciseness, understandability, and functionality. Unfortunately, this means I'm spending more time than ever before considering the semantics of what i write, instead of just shitting out code. How sickening. I'm not gonna do that here.

for clarity (lol) I'm implementing all the solutions to the Linked List problems in one long .c file where I just change main.c depending on which solution I want to test, and I'm too lazy to set up an extension for c on visual studio so i'm using notepad++ and copypasting the entire file into an online c compiler.
